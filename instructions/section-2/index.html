                    <p>I'm an aspiring developer currently attending Code The Dream School.
                    I'm interested in any type of web and software development that requires creativity.
                    I have worked at a tech start up company, as a customer service role, but the technical side of things piqued my interest.

                    In my free time you can find me playing video games, reading manga, binging a tv series or at an anime convention with my family.</p>
