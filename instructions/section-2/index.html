            <h2>About</h2>

                <p>I'm an aspiring developer currently attending Code The Dream School.
                I'm interested in any type of web and software development that requires creativity.
                I have worked at a tech start up company, as a customer service role, but the technical side of things piqued my interest.
                In my free time you can find me playing video games, reading manga, binging a tv series or at an anime convention with my family.</p>
